# RESUME SCANNER USING KEYWORD EXTRACTION

### Overview:
- This project showcases an AI-powered solution to automatically match resumes with job descriptions using advanced keyword extraction and similarity scoring techniques. By applying TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency) and cosine similarity, the system evaluates how closely each resume aligns with the requirements of a given job description.
- Designed to be simple yet effective, this tool empowers recruiters, HR professionals, and job seekers to streamline the hiring process, reduce manual effort, and quickly identify the most relevant candidates for any role.


### Key Features:
- Keyword Extraction → Identifies important terms from resumes and job descriptions using TF-IDF Vectorization.
- Similarity Scoring → Calculates how closely each resume matches the job description using cosine similarity.
- Threshold Filtering → Automatically highlights resumes that meet or exceed a configurable similarity threshold.
- Structured Output → Generates a clean DataFrame with resume IDs and their corresponding similarity scores for easy analysis.
